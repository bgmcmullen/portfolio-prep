Tite: Symphonic Coding (that's probably a terrible title)

Headline: Well rounded software developer with a background in music technology, music production, music theory, music composition and experience teaching courses at an Ivy league University. Passionate about solving problems with creative solutions. Eager to contribute to a collaborative and creative team.

Pitch: Iâ€™m a JavaScripting developer who love the both the practicle side and creative art of coding a career as a software developer. Before studying at coding, I studied music composition, music theory, and audio technology at top tier music schools, taught music theory, and will soon have a PhD in music composition from the University of Pennsylvania. After deciding to leave academia the transition to coding has felt remarkably smooth. My passion and skill for creative thinking I developed studying music has made studying coding feel very natural. I want to harness my skills to be an effective member of a creative team.
